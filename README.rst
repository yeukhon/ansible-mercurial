Mr. Brad Olson developed the same module in the early days of Ansible.
But the module was barely usable for me.


Therefore, I took the entire source code, removed all the core logic 
except the Ansible apis like ``module.params``, and wrote the whole thing up.


My research lab uses ``hg``, not ``git``.
